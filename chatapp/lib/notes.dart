/*
Problem: to check who is the winner. 
to do that we will look which ones are o and which are x.
if eg: 1,2,3 are 0, player 1 wins. if X, then player 2 approx.
so we have to fetch individual data from buttonList.
to use future. 
so in winner we check again and again all the values. 
Problem:
    so winner will be await. 
    in winner, the values will be await. but it returns a future. 
    so,
